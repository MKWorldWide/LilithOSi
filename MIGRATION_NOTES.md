  - mdformat (Markdown formatting)

### GitHub Actions
- **Documentation**: Updated to use GitHub Pages deployment
- **Testing**: Added matrix testing across Python 3.9-3.11
- **Linting**: Added separate job for code quality checks
- **Dependency Caching**: Added caching for faster CI runs

## 📁 Repository Structure

### Added
- `.editorconfig` - Consistent editor settings
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml` - Pre-commit hooks configuration
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` - Contribution guidelines
- `MIGRATION_NOTES.md` - This file
- `.github/workflows/tests.yml` - CI workflow
- `.github/workflows/pages.yml` - Documentation deployment

### Updated

## 🔄 Migration Steps

1. **Update Local Environment**
   ```bash
   # Install pre-commit
   pip install pre-commit
   
   # Install development dependencies
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
   
   # Install pre-commit hooks
   pre-commit install
   ```

2. **Run Pre-commit**
   ```bash
   pre-commit run --all-files
   ```

3. **Update Dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Add new production dependencies
   pip install <package>
   pip freeze | grep -v "pkg-resources" > requirements.txt
   
   # Add new development dependencies
   pip install <dev-package>
   pip freeze | grep -v "pkg-resources" > requirements-dev.txt
   ```

## 🚨 Breaking Changes

- None. This update is backward compatible with existing code.

## 📅 Changelog

### Added
