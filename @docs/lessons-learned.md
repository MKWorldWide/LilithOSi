# LilithOS Lessons Learned

## Development Insights

### iOS Version Compatibility
- **iOS 9.3.6**: Relatively simple to modify, minimal security restrictions
- **iOS 17.x**: Much stricter security, requires careful handling of:
  - System Integrity Protection (SIP)
  - Secure Enclave modifications
  - Code signing requirements
  - Boot chain integrity

### Device Architecture Considerations
- **iPhone 4S (A5)**: ARMv7 architecture, simpler kernel modifications
- **iPhone 13 Pro Max (A15)**: ARM64 architecture, complex multi-core handling
- **Memory Management**: A15 has much more RAM and different memory architecture

### Build System Evolution
- **Original**: Basic batch scripts, limited cross-platform support
- **Modern**: Python-based with Docker, better dependency management
- **Key Improvements**: Automated testing, CI/CD integration, better error handling

### Security Best Practices
- Always maintain system integrity
- Implement proper code signing
- Handle Secure Enclave carefully
- Document all security implications
- Test thoroughly before deployment

### Performance Optimization
- Kernel-level modifications require careful testing
- System service modifications can impact battery life
- Memory management is critical for stability
- Boot time optimizations are important for user experience

## Common Pitfalls
- Not testing on actual hardware before release
- Ignoring security implications of modifications
- Poor documentation of changes
- Not maintaining backward compatibility
- Insufficient error handling in build scripts

## Success Factors
- Comprehensive testing framework
- Clear documentation and changelog
- Proper version control
- Automated build and deployment
- Regular security audits
